### Project Overview

 Introduction to Probability
Probability of the Loan Defaulters
For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.

Problem Statement
What is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?

### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we will have a better understanding of probability. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.

Independency check
Bayes theorem
Visualizing discrete variable
Visualizing continuous variable


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 using probability rules and formulas we are able to solve this data visualizing and wrangling problem  


### Challenges faced

 complex rules and formulas but not a big issues to solve it try i bit hard to solve 


### Additional pointers

 no
